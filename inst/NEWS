CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.2
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES
   
    o New code to deal with experimental setups with a natural pairing between   
      treatment and control samples. The user have to define the pairings 
      and the resulting p-values of the independent tests are combined
      with the Fisher method. A method that corrects these p-values
      (and also those obtained in single samples settings) considering the
      multiple testing issue has also been added.
