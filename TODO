MAybe check step is not so nice to the user...maybe we should allow repeating a step already done 
deleting all "future data"...this problem exists because I added the strandness parameter to countPrePost :/

BE AWARE THAT IF m/M are both negative the roar will result positive but it won't mean a thing. 
Maybe the best approach is changing to NA's all these values before returing the results...or leave
them but explain well that they should be discarded. ask Paolo.

The setClass function returns a special function called a constructor, that can
be used to create an instance of the class.

The readGappedAlignments function takes an additional argument, param, allowing the user to specify
regions of the BAM file (e.g., known gene coordinates)

> strand(aln) <- "*"
# protocol not strand-aware

The counts in one BAM file are independent of counts in another BAM file. This encourages us to count
reads in each BAM file in parallel, decreasing the length of time required to execute our program.

gns is a Granges object -----> write tests and then add this to check.

write .Rd foreach function 
then test that function

ENFORCE THAT THE gene_id HAS TO END with "_PRE"" AND THE GTF SORTING!
-> the order is built when calling the GRanges constructor and
I added "$" at the end of the grep.
TODO final test on every possible strange condition that could arise.

TODO stranded with default false
