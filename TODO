MAybe check step is not so nice to the user...maybe we should allow repeating a step already done 
deleting all "future data"...this problem exists because I added the strandness parameter to countPrePost :/

BE AWARE THAT IF m/M are both negative the roar will result positive but it won't mean a thing. 
Maybe the best approach is changing to NA's all these values before returing the results...or leave
them but explain well that they should be discarded. ask Paolo.

The setClass function returns a special function called a constructor, that can
be used to create an instance of the class.
slots and not representation (deprecated)

The counts in one BAM file are independent of counts in another BAM file. This encourages us to count
reads in each BAM file in parallel, decreasing the length of time required to execute our program. 

Is it possible to load only reads falling over certain coord? Will it perform better?

gns is a Granges object -----> write tests and then add this to check.

ENFORCE THAT THE gene_id HAS TO END with "_PRE"" AND THE GTF SORTING!
-> the order is built when calling the GRanges constructor and
I added "$" at the end of the grep. XXXX CHECK! IT does not seem true (what I say about the GRanges
constructor) -> fixed it reordening the GRange object in the constructors.
there aren't checks about the gene_id names...add them.

TODO final test on every possible strange condition that could arise.
